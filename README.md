# Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) on Github

Welcome to the mdn repository! This is a meta repository containing information, procedures, and resources related to all the repos inside the mdn organization â€” the Mozilla Developer Network's home on GitHub for demos, data, and other resources.

## Making changes to MDN repos

If you wish to make changes to our code demos or other resources, you don't need special privileges (as described in the below section). The correct process for making changes is to:

* Fork the repo you wish to change.
* Create a new branch to contain your change. Call it something descriptive, such as `chrome-bug-fix`, or `add-object-fit-example`.
* Clone your fork locally.
* Make your change.
* Push it to your remote fork.
* Make a pull request to the original repo.

If you are not sure how to complete the above steps, GitHub's [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#fork-an-example-repository) guide is a good place to start.

## Requesting privileges for MDN repos

If you wish to become a collaborator on one of our MDN repos (for example, if you wish to help review pull requests), you should make this request by filing an issue again either this repo (mdn), or the repo you want to collaborate to. Either is OK.

To become a collaborator, you are required to:

* Agree to abide by our [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Set up [Two factor authentication](https://github.com/blog/1614-two-factor-authentication) on your GitHub account.

Once you have filed your issue, someone from our team will review it, and give you the necessary privileges provided our requirements are satisfied.
